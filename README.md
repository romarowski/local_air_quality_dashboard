# Local Air Quality and Aircraft Operations Dashboard

I developed an MVP dashboard that consumed Local Air Quality (concentrations of different pollutants) and Traffic data in the surroundings of an Airport. The LAQ measurements were taken by a set of [Oizom Polludrone](https://oizom.com/product/polludrone-air-pollution-monitoring/) sensors. The dashboard is hosted on Heroku and uses Python, Dash, Plotly and Pandas. It also includes an automated reporting tool that combined LaTeX and Python.
